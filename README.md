# Heart Disease Diagnostic Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to analyze and predict heart disease using various machine learning techniques. The dataset used contains patient health parameters, which are explored and modeled to assess the likelihood of heart disease.

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Preprocessing
- Feature Engineering
- Visualizations & Insights

## Installation
To run this project locally, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn jupyter
```

## Dataset
The dataset includes medical attributes such as:
- Age
- Sex
- Blood Pressure
- Cholesterol Levels
- Heart Rate
- Other vital health metrics

## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, data normalization, and encoding categorical features.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing trends and relationships in the dataset.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Selecting relevant features to improve model accuracy.


## Usage
To run the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook "Heart Disease Diagnostic Analysis.ipynb"
```

## Results
- Identified key risk factors associated with heart disease.
- Achieved high accuracy in predicting heart disease using optimized models.
- Developed insights to help medical professionals assess patient risks more effectively.
